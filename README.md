# Hello World with React boilerplate

Start coding a react application

> If you are working locally instead of using codespaces or gitpod, please follow [local installation steps](#local-installation-skip-if-you-are-working-on-codespaces-or-gitpod) and come back to this part of the readme.

## How to start coding?

- Install the packages with `$ npm install`.
- Run the webpack server with `$ npm run start`

You can update the `styles/index.css` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.

## Local Installation (skip if you are working on codespaces or gitpod)

Download the boilerplate using git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```

## Publish your website!

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting.

## Other features

- Automatic Code Formatting: Use of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automatic code indentation and formatting.
- Error reporting: Use of [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for better error reporting.
- Hot Deploy: Use of [Webpack Development Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) for hot deploy and live reload.
- One-command publish of the code to github pages with `npm run deploy:github`.
- Babel 7 (really fast).
